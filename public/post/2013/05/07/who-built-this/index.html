<p>Alex and I met online first, but we met in person at the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/03/05/app-net-hackathon-recap/">App.net hackathon</a> in March. We immediately struck up a conversation about publishing technology, which I quickly learned was a major mission of his. He volunteered to build the Portalpress software that powers The Daily Portal because it allowed him to hack on a variety of his favorite problems. A hacker and writer who cares about reading has superhero status to me.</p>

<p>Alex is a developer at <a href="http://join.app.net">App.net</a>. He blogs about code at <a href="http://alexkessinger.net">alexkessinger.net</a> and tech and media at <a href="http://www.rumproarious.com/">rumproarious</a>.</p>

<h3>designer</h3></center>


<br />


<p>Grayson was my passenger for the drive up to a <a href="http://thedigitaldetox.org">Digital Detox</a> retreat. We didn't know each other before he got in the car, but we had a couple three-hour drives and a long weekend of Internet-free quality time to get to know each other. He's a clear-seeing artist who values good handiwork.</p>

<p>One of the rules on the retreat was to not talk about work, which I was glad to obey, but Grayson was bursting with enthusiasm for his work the whole time. I appreciated that energy. When we were driving home, he was finally able to tell me that he was the designer for Coffee &amp; Power, a company I loved and wrote about in my early days as a tech reporter. When I needed help turning these ideas into pixels, I knew who to call.</p>

<p>Grayson is now designing virtual worlds at <a href="http://highfidelity.io/">High Fidelity</a>, the new company from the team that brought us Coffee &amp; Power.</p>

<br />


<p>... And when I needed help turning pixels into code, Grayson knew who to call. Grayson and Dmitry have worked together before, so I trusted him implicitly, and I'm glad I did. Dima knows all kinds of web technologies, and he's also a visionary photographer. That's a potent combination for someone who turns still images into working web experiences. And I don't have to tell you how fine a job he did; you're seeing that for yourself right now.</p>

<p>Dmitry's portfolio, photography, and blog are at <a href="http://belitsky.info/">belitsky.info</a>, and you can also hire him there.</p>

<h3>portalmaker</h3></center>


<br />


<p>Harlan is the reason The Daily Portal exists. He builds the <a href="http://www.transportals.org/">resonating portal sculptures</a> you've seen around the site, and he brings them to <a href="http://burningman.com">Burning Man</a> and other festivals. Harlan calls his portals "evolutionary interfaces." They're contained spaces, vibrating with a low tone, designed to bring people in tune with each other.</p>

<p>I had a <a href="http://everythingisablaze.com/blog/the-american-dream">series</a> of <a href="http://blog.burningman.com/2012/11/tales-from-the-playa/astronauts/">transformative</a> experiences in his portals over the years, but in 2012, I finally got to <a href="http://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/tales-from-the-playa/keeping-the-portal/">meet him there</a>. We talked about how his art is a platform for other people to be creative, and that blew my mind. I didn't know what I had learned until months later, when The Daily Portal was born.</p>

<p>You can check out Harlan's portals and subscribe to his newsletter on <a href="http://www.transportals.org/">transportals.org</a>.</p>

<br />


<p>I'm Jon. My spirit animal is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus">octopus</a>. I write and play music. I care about language. I think about the future all the time.</p>

<p>I'm a Buddhist. I'm from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. I lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland</a> for a while. Now I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland">Oakland</a>. Some combination of all three of these cities would be my ideal place. But I also have a thing for islands, which cities kind of are... Well, anyway,</p>

<p>I started The Daily Portal because I realized that <a href="http://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/tales-from-the-playa/keeping-the-portal/">I wanted to be a portalkeeper when I grew up</a>. I used to write news about computers and telephones at <a href="http://readwrite.com">ReadWrite(Web)</a>, but the scope was too small. So now I write <a href="http://everythingisablaze.com/blog/the-daily-portal">cosmos journalism</a> stories about the future we're making and what it's doing to us.</p>

<p>My personal site is <a href="http://everythingisablaze.com">Everything is ablaze!</a>. You can find my portfolio and other projects there, as well as <a href="http://everythingisablaze.com/blog">my blog about life</a> and <a href="http://everythingisablaze.com/afterthoughts">my blog about working in web publishing</a>.</p>
