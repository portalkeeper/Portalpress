story_intro: "<strong>YEAH, I GET</strong> that journalism is a public service. It’s done out of a civic duty to inform people about the world. But I've always related to my journalism role as more of an art project."

When I worked in a newsroom, I knew a lot of News People. The emergence of new information was inherently interesting to them. They sat glued to their news sources waiting for something to happen, and they jumped on whatever it was as soon as it did. Their job was to process and package new information for safe human consumption, skillfully balancing speed and accuracy.

I got the appeal. Writing news is such a rush. But I was always more interested in people’s reaction to the news than to the news itself. Real news, made-up stories, movies and albums, viral videos, it was all the same to me in this regard. I appreciate a good fact like any scientifically-minded person, but the collective psychic reaction to information — real or imaginary — was always the more important event to me.

Telling a story is an editorial act. A story is always incomplete. There are always more facts and details than can be included in a human telling. And inevitably, since storytelling is so cathartic, humans will include details and asides that are unnecessary, helping the teller but boring or misleading the listener. That is to say, Journalism™ — the kind that tells people objectively what is going on — is impossible.

The art of journalism is two-fold: It’s the art of deciding which stories are significant, and it’s the art of revealing significance that readers could easily miss. I love those arts. I just don’t think stories have to be about *facts* to be significant. Even “hard news” stories are sometimes more about feelings than facts, even if an editor tried valiantly to convince us otherwise.

Surely, we can all agree on this: the reason to tell a story is to communicate something significant. If it’s not significant, it’s not worth the energy. “Cool story, bro,” as the Internet is wont to say.

The storyteller’s calculus is, **why am I telling this story, and given that, how do I tell it?** In the balance of the storyteller’s needs and the listeners' needs, there is an outcome. The success of the story is the achievement of the outcome.

No matter the subject, I think **the most important thing about a story is what it does to us**. Does it make us better? Stronger? More prepared? Does it frighten us? Does it paralyze us? Anger us? Cause us pain? A story is an instrument. Told poorly, a story might do none of these things. Told well, it does more than just enter data into listeners’ minds. It changes their whole bodies.

I believe the storyteller’s duty is to communicate well, not merely to say. This is the realm of art to me. It’s beyond information. It is irrational as well as rational.

My commitment is not to information. It is to you.
