story_intro: "<strong>HARLAN EMIL GRUBER</strong>, the Portalmaker, is an intricate shape of a person."
---
The whole of him is friendly and affable, but he has many manifold facets that appear at angles to the people around him. Some of his sides are short and clear, some are long and convoluted, others are infinitely vast. One day, he's lecturing obsessively on the esoteric details of sacred geometry, going way past his alloted time. The next, he's inviting people to his camp and serving vegetarian green chili from his home in New Mexico, not even expecting his guests to wash their bowls.

By far, his most visible aspect is the art he leaves in the world. Harlan [builds portals](http://transportals.org) in various shapes, colors, and sizes. The shapes are usually pure or slightly transformed Platonic solids. They're designed to be interacted with, sat inside, climbed upon, and — crucially — listened to.

Back in the '80s. Harlan played bass in a new wave band. While practicing late one night, he got his instrument to feed back through his amplifier, creating an awesome sound. It so impressed him that he stopped playing to experiment with the feedback. He leaned his bass against his amp, the pickups facing the speakers, letting the feedback build into a roar. Then he began detuning the strings. He wanted to find the lowest note that would feed back.

That note turned out to be surprisingly low. With the strings so slackened that he could see the waves moving across their length, the overtones fed back out of the amp as a deep rumble, like electric purring. Harlan had invented a new instrument by accident.

His portals now come equipped with a [Quasar Wave Transducer](http://harlanemil.com/quasar.html), two bass strings under low tension stretched over a pickup housed atop an amplifier. When Harlan has finished assembling a portal, he plugs in the transducer, turns it on, then carefully adjusts the tension of the strings until the desired throb is achieved. The whole structure <a href='/splash.html' target='_blank'>purrs and moans and rattles with the sound</a>.

The sound and geometry of the portals are meant to transform the people inside them. You go in curiously, perhaps apprehensively. You sit inside and become calm, ordered, meditative. It bonds you with the other people inside, with yourself, and with the portal. You emerge changed, configured by the portal to be grounded and grounding to others. The effect is strong and quick-acting.

Harlan brings portals to gatherings of people who he believes will benefit from their presence and effects. This weekend, he brought two of them to a mountaintop gathering convened by friends of mine. After several transformations in Harlan's portals leading to the creation of The Daily Portal, these devices have become hugely important to me, so their presence at a gathering of so many people I love was a thrilling opportunity. Moreover, this was my chance to bond with the Portalmaker, who was coming to know me, in his fondly meant words, as "the Portalkeeper guy."

On the first day of the party, I ended up building two portals with Harlan by hand. One was the inner structure of the [1:11 Sapphire Portal](http://www.transportals.org/?p=4), the first one [I ever encountered](/post/05/13/2008-the-american-dream). I camped right next to its purring heart all weekend. [Grayson](https://app.net/problem), who designed The Daily Portal with me, built it with us. It was a joy, having just finished building the virtual portal where you're reading right now, for Grayson and me to build one of the real, solid, metal-and-wood portals together.

Harlan led us through each step, staking down the blue floor, assembling and lifting the metal frames, bolting on the 10 triangular mirrors, stringing up small, blue lights, wiring up the QUasar Wave Transducer, running an extension cord through the woods to the nearest generator, placing the red, dodecahedral cover on the center, turning it on.

Harlan didn't have a step-by-step procedure, he explained. He had learned the easiest ways to put these things together by practicing. As he replaced worn out components over the years, he learned to make corrections such as drilling oversized holes to compensate for imprecision, allowing us to bolt the pieces together with minimal adjustment. He took pride in those clever hacks, but he was humble about his skills as an engineer. He grunted and cursed right along with us as we lifted and held and ratcheted and hammered the portal together. He smiled along with us when it purred to life.

The second portal was just the white, metal frame in the shape of the [11:11 Diamond Portal](http://www.transportals.org/?p=8), the first one Harlan built. We put it on the ridge at the edge of camp. We bolted together the tubes and stood up the frame as it was getting dark. People climbed up the frame all night to see the stars. Many watched the sunrise there, too.
