Second day. Everything seems to confound my plans. I figure out a plan to walk the coastline, but the rain comes, and I get lost.

At dusk, I found the octopi. They danced by the shore for just a moment when I arrived, then fell silent.

I followed the ecliptic. I watched the sunset on the second evening, and I saw the moon rise. Then I noticed the standing stones were aligned along the ecliptic. So I followed the line west, and I ended up in a circle of standing stones. The fireflies were moving around the circle, and the music was, too. So I went with them until they swirled around me. Then suddenly night became day and then night and then day, and the seasons changed, but then the portal went white, and I faded out. I came to on a slightly different island.

Chasing turkeys at night.

Follow the white (glowing) rabbit.

It’s the same island, at least partially. The stone gods are still there. He disappears into the water.

I start down the road, and the music gets louder.

The octopi are on land! They’re dancing and drumming near the second set of ruined towers.

WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?

Just had my second sudden, intense burst of speed.

I tried to leave the circle this time, but eventually I went in. I’ve warped again. This time, the stone circle was musical, and I could play it. I can still play on the other side of the portal, but nothing else happens.

RED SKY AT NIGHT IN THE IDOL CIRCLE

It took me to the grove. A critter appeared, I chased him to an owl, then the circle returned.

Lost in yellow fog under a purple sky.

It’s lifting me up!
