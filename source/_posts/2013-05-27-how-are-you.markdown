Are you bored yet?

How many times a day do you have that conversation? Are you listening to the other person's answer? Do you answer the question honestly?

Why do we greet each other this way? "How are you?" is such a heavy question. It requires comprehensive introspection. But we almost always ask it in situations that make such introspection impossible, or at least impolite. So we skip it. We say, "Fine," and immediately push it off: "How are you?"

If anything about this bothers you, you might be a portalkeeper.

If we portalkeepers had our way, one of two things would be true: Either we would use a more respectful greeting — like "hello" — that demands less of others, or we would stay for a moment with *everyone* we greet, ask them how they honestly are, and listen to them for as long as they need us. Either way, we'd be better portalkeepers than we are now.

In my world, the portal — as you might have guessed by now — does not refer simply to the physical structures that [gave it its name](http://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/tales-from-the-playa/keeping-the-portal/). A portal is a doorway, an opening, a passage, and those [self-contained works of art](http://www.transportals.org) do not obviously fit the definition. One must ask why "portal" is the name for those spaces and why it seems so apt. [Harlan, the portalmaker](http://thedailyportal.com/post/2013/05/13/portalmaker/), has his own answers. If you ask me, I think the word "portal" refers to the passageways opened by the structures *between their inhabitants.*

The interface between one person and another is a critical piece of human infrastructure. It enables communication, which enables cooperation, which enables society. Without that connection, what would be human about us? And yet, as far as this English speaker knows, our language doesn't have a name for it yet. I call it the portal. **The portal is the interface between people.**

How open is your portal? What makes it close up? Do you keep it open for every encounter, or do you close it for some people? When a homeless person asks you for money on the street, how open is your portal? What about when you're talking to someone attractive at a party, whom you just met? What about when your mother calls? When you're eating dinner with your partner? When you're at work, instant-messaging your friend across the country, who is also at work?

How open is your portal right now?

Every human being deserves time to close her portal and rest. Interface is exhausting, and rest is a human right. But every human being also deserves to communicate with others through wide-open portals. We need each other. [Isolation kills us](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113176/science-loneliness-how-isolation-can-kill-you). When we're together, we have a moral responsibility to keep our portals open. We're not going to make it to the future alone.

**The Daily Portal's mission is to open the portals between people, so they can better know each other and work together.**
