Alex and I met online first, but we met in person at the [App.net hackathon](http://blog.app.net/2013/03/05/app-net-hackathon-recap/) in March. We immediately struck up a conversation about publishing technology, which I quickly learned was a major mission of his. He volunteered to build the Portalpress software that powers The Daily Portal because it allowed him to hack on a variety of his favorite problems. A hacker and writer who cares about reading has superhero status to me.

Alex is a developer at [App.net](http://join.app.net). He blogs about code at [alexkessinger.net](http://alexkessinger.net) and tech and media at [rumproarious](http://www.rumproarious.com/).

<h3>designer</h3></center><br />

Grayson was my passenger for the drive up to a [Digital Detox](http://thedigitaldetox.org) retreat. We didn’t know each other before he got in the car, but we had a couple three-hour drives and a long weekend of Internet-free quality time to get to know each other. He’s a clear-seeing artist who values good handiwork.

One of the rules on the retreat was to not talk about work, which I was glad to obey, but Grayson was bursting with enthusiasm for his work the whole time. I appreciated that energy. When we were driving home, he was finally able to tell me that he was the designer for Coffee & Power, a company I loved and wrote about in my early days as a tech reporter. When I needed help turning these ideas into pixels, I knew who to call.

Grayson is now designing virtual worlds at [High Fidelity](http://highfidelity.io/), the new company from the team that brought us Coffee & Power.

... And when I needed help turning pixels into code, Grayson knew who to call. Grayson and Dmitry have worked together before, so I trusted him implicitly, and I’m glad I did. Dima knows all kinds of web technologies, and he’s also a visionary photographer. That’s a potent combination for someone who turns still images into working web experiences. And I don’t have to tell you how fine a job he did; you’re seeing that for yourself right now.

Dmitry’s portfolio, photography, and blog are at [belitsky.info](http://belitsky.info/), and you can also hire him there.

<h3>portalmaker</h3></center><br />

Harlan is [the reason The Daily Portal exists](/post/2013/05/13/portalmaker/). He builds the [resonating portal sculptures](http://www.transportals.org/) you’ve seen around the site, and he brings them to [Burning Man](http://burningman.com) and other festivals. Harlan calls his portals “evolutionary interfaces.” They’re contained spaces, vibrating with a low tone, designed to bring people in tune with each other.

I had a [series](/post/2013/05/13/2008-the-american-dream) of [transformative](/post/2013/05/13/2011-astronauts) experiences in his portals over the years, but in 2012, I finally got to [meet him there](/post/2013/05/13/2012-keeping-the-portal). We talked about how his art is a platform for other people to be creative, and that blew my mind. I didn’t know what I had learned until months later, when The Daily Portal was born.

You can check out Harlan’s portals and subscribe to his newsletter on [transportals.org](http://www.transportals.org/).

<h3>portalkeeper</h3></center><br />

I’m Jon. My spirit animal is the [octopus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus). I write and play music. I care about language. I think about the future all the time.

I’m a Buddhist. I’m from [Atlanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta). I lived in [Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) for a while. Now I live in [Oakland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland). Some combination of all three of these cities would be my ideal place. But I also have a thing for islands, which cities kind of are… Well, anyway,

I started The Daily Portal because I realized that [I wanted to be a portalkeeper when I grew up](http://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/tales-from-the-playa/keeping-the-portal/). I used to write news about computers and telephones at [ReadWrite(Web)](http://readwrite.com), but the scope was too small. So now I write [cosmos journalism](http://everythingisablaze.com/blog/the-daily-portal) stories about the future we’re making and what it’s doing to us.

My personal site is [Everything is ablaze!](http://everythingisablaze.com). You can find my portfolio and other projects there, as well as [my blog about life](http://everythingisablaze.com/blog) and [my blog about working in web publishing](http://everythingisablaze.com/afterthoughts).
