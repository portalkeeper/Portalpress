story_intro: "<strong>PORTALS ARE A</strong> microcosm of my beat as a journalist, if you can believe that. The first <a href='http://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/tales-from-the-playa/keeping-the-portal/'>portalkeeper’s log</a> was part of my coverage of <a href='http://www.burningman.com'>Burning Man</a>, a Bay Area-based, worldwide culture that centers around an annual, temporary city in the desert."

I [write](http://blog.burningman.com/author/jmitchell/) and [edit](http://blog.burningman.com/category/tales-from-the-playa/) for the Burning Man organization, usually about the festival itself. But all of us who put enormous time and resources into this week-long party promise that its benefits extend to the rest of the world for the rest of the year.

We say that it teaches us how to be better neighbors and people. We say that it proves to the world that generosity, creativity, and spontaneity are better values than the ones ingrained by the economics of the default world. We believe all that. Is it true?

In recent years, Burning Man has put some weight behind the [Burning Man Project](http://www.burningmanproject.org/), part of a transition of the whole organization toward a nonprofit model designed to teach its values and export its art to the rest of the world. It wants to help. We want it to help.

It starts in the San Francisco Bay Area, a network of cities full of vast disparities. The massive wealth bubble of the technology industry here is actually one of Burning Man’s biggest constituencies. And, as you might guess, the impoverished and desperate communities in the Bay Area’s urban cores are rather underserved by these resources. The Burning Man Project wants to be an artistic, educational, and political diplomat between these two sides of the Bay.

But the inertia is massive. Burning Man is set up to plan and throw a monstrous week-long event with explosions and fireworks, lay miles of road, and support port-a-potties for 60,000 people. It hasn’t yet proven it has the capacity to be a year-round cultural force in places where it doesn’t sell tickets.

So many Burners are watching with interest as Burning Man gets involved with <a href="http://freespace.io/">[freespace]</a>, an enormous civic resource blooming in one of San Francisco’s most blighted areas this month. It’s largely organized by Burners, and some people with explicit affiliations with the Burning Man organization are getting in on the ground floor. Burning Man’s values could not find a more perfect expression than what’s going on at [freespace].

The extent to which Burning Man lends its powerful brand and network to the [freespace] experiment remains to be seen, and I will cover this part of the story closely. My main story about it will be for the [Burning Blog](http://blog.burningman.com), where I’ll be reporting on the [BurnerHack](http://burnerhack.com/) event happening at [freespace] this weekend.

But The Daily Portal’s story is a Burning Man story. So my portalkeeping is implicated in Burning Man’s ability to be a force for good in the world. Since my job for Burning Man is to cover this story for inside that community, it’s a good thing I have The Daily Portal to cover it critically from the outside. If you don’t believe that we’re doing it right, I trust that you’ll [tell me](/about#contact).
