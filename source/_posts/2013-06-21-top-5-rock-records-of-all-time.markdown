Before we begin, let’s define our terms:

**Rock** is defined as guitar- or piano-driven pop music in the blues harmonic tradition developed since the influence of mass media in the mid-20th century.

**Records** are defined as titled, long-playing recorded compositions, usually comprised of multiple shorter compositions. To qualify for this list, a record must have end-to-end integrity, not just isolated standout tracks.

**All time** includes the whole history of rock music, but it is also a forward-looking time span. That is, I assert that, due to changing media consumption habits, unraveling attention spans, and declining popularity of LP listening, the following list will stand forever. (PLEASE prove me wrong on this point. Long live long-playing records!)

**Top** is defined as whatever I say is the top. You are warmly invited to blog out your dissatisfaction.

For more explanations and caveats and stuff about this list, see the [Portalkeeper’s note](/post/2013/06/21/portalkeepers-note) at the end.

Now, then:
