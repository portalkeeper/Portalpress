story_intro: "<strong>WHAT IS A GAME?</strong> I probably heard this question asked aloud a hundred times while covering technology. It was always asked in a way that seemed backwards to me, so I’m afraid I must ask it again."

In my old job, “What is a game?” usually meant, “Do the mechanics of this piece of software or hardware qualify it as a game?” It was as though game was a genre of creative work that had to be made deliberately in accordance with some set of rules. The “What is a game?” question was a wishy-washy attempt to identify those rules.

But I’ve always suspected that a game is actually a mindset. Is this a game, or is this Real Life? It’s not about the board, the pieces, the rules, or whose turn it is. It’s whether you're playing or not.

I don’t think we’re playing enough games. The soaring popularity of software applications that are *not* games is the clearest indication of that. What are email, Facebook, and to-do lists? They’re game-like, except they’re boring, there’s often no object, and no one wins.

If we played these mundane tasks as games, wouldn’t we make them more fun? As long as we designed them well, wouldn’t we be better at them than we are now, treating them as drudgery or as high-pressure demands?

While we’re at it, what about the rest of Real Life? What’s the difference between society and a role-playing game? Real money? [No, that's not it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Second_Life). Society has plenty of rules, roles, and non-player characters to be a game. We just don’t think of it that way.

For people dealt strong hands in the society game, the roles and rules are invisible. This is just the way the world works. Whiteness, maleness, heterosexuality — just to name a few powerful character attributes — these are entrenched as default states. A straight, white male doesn’t have to play that role, he just *is* it effortlessly. At least, it seems that way to him. Others might argue that he’s just playing the game [on the lowest difficulty setting](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/), so he doesn’t even notice the effort.

For people with less power in their hands, the consequences of losing the game are too real to be treated lightly. You can’t forget what role you’re playing when you’re constantly being reminded of it, its otherness, its disadvantages. And you can’t so easily shrug it off as “just a game,” either.

But play a game with me here: What if *everybody* realized it was all a game? What if we realized we were all playing roles, and the way we played affected how others play? What if we stopped taking the rules so seriously and stopped flipping the table as soon as we started to lose? What if we all got better at letting others win?

It would be hard. The stakes of the game are pretty high. But, like any game of skill, we can get better with practice. [Today's issue](/issue/6) is about the games we play in society, practicing them, and making new ones.
