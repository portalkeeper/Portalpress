This record emerges from the sea. It whispers its themes for a while, and then “The Real Me” stomps in. The bass is mixed so high. The musicianship is ridiculous, that much we know, though we don’t know what kind of story we’re about to hear from this band.

It’s one hell of a story.

Many of the great rockstars felt entitled to make sprawling records telling the stories of their personal torment around the middle of their recording careers. Roger Waters made *The Wall*, which, you’ll notice, is not [the Pink Floyd record on this list](/post/2013/06/21/meddle). Pete Townshend’s indulgence in his own madness produced *Quadrophenia*.

Like *The Wall*, it’s some kind of storytelling concept album. But the story didn’t get *Quadrophenia* on this list. The story produced from Townshend the most captivating musical themes he ever wrote, and this massive record is intricately woven through with them.

It’s rock elevated to its highest point artistically. It’s rock as classical music. And that would be burdensome to listen to if Townshend’s sense of humor wasn’t so damn charming. The bridge of “I’ve Had Enough” is the best. That song is so angsty, but when those banjos and harmonies come in, real, crazy wisdom surfaces.

The standout track for me is “I’m One,” because I’m earnest like that. It’s a little weird to identify with the characters on this record, but this is where I do. I think it’s the most honest Pete character, too.

There’s one other moment of the same character later in the record. At the end of “Drowned,” they captured Pete (I think) walking down the street singing the tune to himself. And that does it for me even more than “I’m One” does.

“5:15” is the benchmark of how The Who have evolved. The reference to the 1965 proto-punk club banger “My Generation” in the verse means so much surrounded by this huge band full of horns and keys. When I saw The Who play *Quadrophenia* earlier this year, John Entwistle played a big-screen bass solo on “5:15” from beyond the grave.

Yes, there are lots of ocean and rain sounds on this record. They would be cheesy elsewhere. But you are allowed to do that when the god of thunder plays drums in your band. Keith actually *sings* — or yells, really — on “Bell Boy,” and he is exactly the right being for the job.

After “Bell Boy,” unfortunately, comes “Dr. Jimmy,” the longest, most reckless track. It’s all about getting high and drunk and being a terrible person, whereas at least some of the earlier songs are about getting high without as much terribleness. It’s a character. It’s clearly an attempt to exorcise some evil. But it’s creepy to hear, and it drags on and on.

But the last two tracks on *Quadrophenia* bring this long record’s many themes back and open them all the way up. It’s some of the highest musicianship The Who ever displayed. To our relief, this isn’t done with complete self-seriousness, either; there’s a damn talk box on “The Rock.” But the emotional peak is right here at the end. “Love, Reign O’er Me” will wear you out, that song is so heavy.
