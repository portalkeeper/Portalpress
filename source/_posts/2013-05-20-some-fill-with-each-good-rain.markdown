<center><p>There are different wells within your heart.<br />
Some fill with each good rain.<br />
Others are far too deep for that.</p>
 
<p>In one well,<br />
You have just a few precious cups of water.</p>
 
<p>That love is something of yourself.<br />
It can grow as slow as a diamond<br />
If it is lost.</p>
 
<p>Your love<br />
Should never be offered to the mouth of a<br />
Stranger,</p>
 
<p>Only to someone<br />
Who has the valor and daring<br />
To cut pieces of their soul off with a knife</p>
 
<p>Then weave them into a blanket<br />
To protect you.</p>
 
<p>There are different wells within us.<br />
Some fill with each good rain.</p>
 
<p>Others are far, far too deep<br />
For that.</p></center>

*from [The Gift](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Gift.html?id=_cdWZkYE_ZQC), translations of Hafiz by Daniel Ladinsky, with modifications by me. I took out the air quotes around love, deleted the word “literally,” which is the worst poetry word available in English, and fixed punctuation marks.*
