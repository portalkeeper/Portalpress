story_intro: "<strong>THIS YEAR AT</strong> Burning Man, I figured out what I want to be when I grow up."
---
My dream job was just there waiting for me. No one was doing it, so I did it. I climbed up into the [12:21 Turquoise Portal](http://www.transportals.org/?p=170), and I became the Portalkeeper.

I sought out the portal this year after my first couple of days at Burning Man played eerily out of tune. I didn't realize when I left camp that I was walking toward the rest of my life.

## Wednesday night

> "This Burn has involved some personal awfulness, which has been written awfully in another book. Tonight, I have decided to do something radical for myself. I have walked to the Turquoise Portal, from which the city is but a low, twinkling hum, and I have it in my mind to stay here all night."

I sat silently for a few minutes, and then I chanted slowly along with the Quasar Wave Transducer, whose frequency was my baseline that night. As soon as I stopped chanting, my first visitor passed, a big guy with a well-lit bike.

"Hello," he called to me.

My eyes were closed, and I was not lit up, but I replied, "Hi."

"Wow, that's crazy," he remarked to himself.

"Want to come up?" I asked.

"No, thanks man. I'm just traveling along, trying to see how far I can go."

"Enjoy."

"Thanks, man. You, too!"

The encounter moved me to write my first journal entry. My decision to sit in the portal had led to a story. But the story took a weird turn after what felt like much too short a time — the Quasar Wave Transducer shut off.

I waited and waited, but the purring machine stayed silent. I felt colder. I wanted that vibration to carry me through the night, and it was gone.

I decided I would go for a long walk and return to the portal at the end. If, by some miracle, the Wave was back, I would be able to stay and carry out my mission.

As I returned to the portal, I was sure that the resonator would still be offline. Instead, I found two nice travelers inside, and the vibrations were back. As we sat and talked, a parade of great folks came through, and a man played guitar for us. He played "Somewhere Over The Rainbow," and we sang along quietly.

After some time, the vibrations stopped again, and my new friends left. But it wasn't long before a new group joined, and they knew the portal was supposed to be purring and wasn't. I assured them it would come back.

Then I put my hand on the floor, and I felt it. It was low, but it was coming back. They were skeptical, but then, with a great roar, the Portal burst back into song.

As the night rolled on, I was joined by many more travelers for a long spiral of conversations. People arrived as others left, so the threads of talk were continuous.

There was Yankee, the futurist, who provided a delightful challenge to my resentful ideas about bringing Web technology to Burning Man. Every time I cried out that smart devices would destroy the precious immediacy of our encounters and relationships there, he showed how technology might help in ways we'd have to try out to understand.

And then there were Dana and Mike. It was Mike's first Burn, and Dana had brought him out to deep playa to see where the quiet types, the real, wandering desert prophet people, like to hang out at night. These two stayed with me through sunrise.

These were my kind of people. We aren't Opulent Temple faux-fur lose-ourselves dancers. We're about finding ourselves — and each other — out there where it's dark and quiet and easy to think. That's where the portal is, so it's people like us who find it.

But damn, does it get cold out there at night.

At the darkest, coldest, bleakest nadir of the night, someone approached and started fiddling with the outside of the portal.

"Want to come up?" I asked.

"Yes, I just have to turn the internal lights on and check the battery level, and maybe adjust the sound."

"Are you Harlan Gruber?" I nearly gasped.

"Yeah."

"Please come up," I implored him. "We have so many questions for you."

Soft, purple triangles of light switched on in a ring around the portal's floor, and the Quasar Wave Transducer growled with new intensity. Then the Portal Maker climbed in with us.

He entertained us with answers to the many questions that arose for us throughout the night, and he loved hearing our portal tales.

For one thing, Harlan explained that this year, the Quasar Wave Transducer shuts down 12 times a day for 21 minutes at a time. It wasn't broken, it was emphasizing the time cycle around which the 12:21 Turquoise Portal was designed.

He explained that the sacred geometry gives form to this idea of the portal, but the music we play with it is the point, and it speaks for itself. He compared himself to Les Paul, eponymous inventor of that iconic electric guitar. "No one cared about the Les Paul until Jimmy Page got a hold of one," Harlan said.

## Saturday night

After the Man burned, I walked out to the portal with my brother. We wanted a good vantage point from which to look upon the chaos of the city. I realized that, from the Turquoise Portal's perch near the top of the city, 5,800 feet away, the view was like looking down on the planet of Black Rock City from orbit.

So we sat at the portal for a while, talking to a variety of passers through. Then we left it in the capable hands of a man named Daniel, who seemed to dig the portal the same way we did, and we descended back into the madness. Eventually, my brother and I parted ways.

After a loud, long night of post-Burn anarchy, I felt the need to go back into orbit. My friend Sarah wanted to wander the deep playa by herself, and I offered to walk out to the portal with her. She could wander wherever she pleased, and I'd be there in the portal if she needed a friend again.

I was perfectly content to sit and keep the portal again. I had a lot of reflecting to do. I had begun to realize that I felt at home in the portal.

Keeping a portal felt like an occupation that could fulfill me like none other I've tried. While it was empty, I could meditate, read, write, and sing along with its vibrations. When someone arrived, I could talk to them, tune in with them, and send them on their way. That would be enough for me.

I made a log entry on my voice recorder that I'll keep around as long as I've got the technology to listen to it. It's kind of strange and sensitive, but I'll share it anyway.

Then I sang. I sang loudly to the song of the portal. I was the Portalkeeper, so I sang the Portal Song.

First I hummed the main note that I heard, loudly, using my whole head. Then I began to explore other intervals, fourths and fifths, staying conscious of the portal's perfect 2012 geometry. As my breath ran out, I tore off the last note like a bite of salty food, savoring for desert survival. Then I began to throat-sing, whistling out higher overtones, just like the Quasar Wave Transducer does.

Someone climbed up as I was singing. It was my brother. He seemed as surprised as I was. I told him what I was doing, and I began to cry. He urged me not to stop.

Not long after, others came. I told them about the singing. I described throat singing, which most of them hadn't heard of before, and then I sang for them. I was self-conscious, but I didn't need to be. I kept the song short, and some of them joined in.

One of them said this was his last Burn. "Havin' a kid, movin' on," he said. When I asked him how many times he'd been to Burning Man, he said, "Many times." Eventually, he revealed that he'd been 17 times. "I come here to settle shit," he said, "and I finally settled it."

As sunrise approached, Harlan came back and brought a friend. After the long night, I was happy to let the Maker keep the portal for us. It was chilly in the portal, but we all kept each other warm until the sun rose, and we walked to the Temple for a light breakfast.

The lesson of my second night as Portalkeeper was that we all need a portal. We all need a place to huddle together, charge up and tune ourselves. A Portalkeeper talks to travelers, puts them at ease, shares stories and bids them farewell. It's an important job, and I want to do it.
