<center><h2>5. Cinnabar Island</h2></center>

You arrive at Cinnabar Island toward the end of [Pokémon](http://www.pokemon.com/), and things are starting to get weird. There are people on the island trying to play God, but their experiments have gone awry. The humans are no match for the exotic monsters they've unleashed. There was also a bug (or cheat) in the game that enabled you to clone your items and catch pokémon way above level 100. By the time you reached Cinnabar Island, it was clear that this world full of monsters wasn't so cute and cuddly anymore.

<center><h2>4. The Secret Island of Dr. Quandary</h2></center>

This island looks like a fun place on the surface, but there was something sinister going on. You wind up there after being trapped in a doll and transported to the island, and you have to pass all kinds of tests, brew a potion, and drink it in order to escape. It's a pretty cool island to visit for a while, but it's a relief to get home again.

<center><h2>3. Koholint Island</h2></center>

</div>

Koholint Island, the setting of Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, is vast, populous, and full of conflict. You meet so many people as you navigate it searching for the musical instruments to wake the Wind Fish. Some of them help you. Some of them try to hurt you. Some of them make you fall in love. You go from the shore to the forest to the swamp to the mountains to the desert, all in the name of love and music. And when you wake the Wind Fish, the dream is over.

<center><h2>2. Myst</h2></center>

<div>

</div>

You reach Myst through a portal inside of a book. It's clearly populated by ingenious people, but you can't find any of them, only their records and cryptic instructions. By reading, exploring, and poking around, you slowly figure out how the buildings on the island link together. You discover other portals in other books. Some books lead to other places. Some books introduce you to people floating in a distorted field inside them. You're the only person free to roam the island. Now what do you do?

<center><h2>1. Proteus</h2></center>

<div>

</div>

You first see Proteus from a distance. You're floating on the water, and the island presents an imposing face. Then you walk on shore and blend into an ecosystem. The branches wave in the wind. Small critters scamper around. Clouds roll in, it rains, then the sun comes out. Sunsets are golden and glorious. Nights are starry and mysterious. And it looks like people might have been here before. Maybe they're still here.
