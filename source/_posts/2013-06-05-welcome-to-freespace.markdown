story_intro: "<strong>THE LUNATICS ARE</strong> now running the asylum. A bunch of artists, hackers, and activists have gained control of a 14,000-square-foot warehouse at 1131 Mission Street, San Francisco, for $1 for the month of June. What happens next is up to us."

I paid my first visit to <a href="http://freespace.io/">[freespace]</a> yesterday. It was the fourth day of the experiment, and things were still under construction. But it was humming with potential. Most of the people there were building or painting something. I started gathering names and stories. All of us were preparing to make something much bigger than our media of choice.

The warehouse is divided into spaces designed for various activities. There’s an open room with a stage on the ground floor, as well as a section in the back for smaller booths, like the community bike-sharing project based there. There’s a large kitchen on the second floor. Above that, there’s ample space for working, sitting and talking, for playing, for movement and yoga, and for quiet contemplation. Outside, enormous murals are going up, some by well-known painters, others by infamous, pseudonymous ones.

Anyone can walk in and benefit from the facility. This is one of the most exciting aspects of the experiment. [freespace] is across the street from an enormous and imposing federal building, and it sits in the middle of one of the toughest economically battered parts of the city. Part of why the city supports this plan is that it’s ready to try just about anything to get this neighborhood to thrive.

The artists at [freespace], many of whom are supported by the vast resources of the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com) community, are going to have to confront this vast power differential in a way we rarely have to do in our remote, ticketed desert paradise. This is one of the stories I most look forward to telling.

Yesterday evening, Lyra Levin held [a salon about Art and Community](http://freespace.io/event/freespace-presents-sf-salon-society-civic-engagement/). We gathered all the chairs, couches, and cushions around the stage in [freespace]’s performance room.

Several artists presented their strategies for getting art made and displayed in urban environments, as well as for democratizing it and making it participatory. I was joined by [Harlan](/post/2013/05/13/portalmaker/), who kindly brought me falafel, and who gave a great lightning-round talk about the portals and how they might fit into public spaces, not just the tranquil festival settings where they usually are.

Then Lyra opened up the floor, and we discussed the way forward. These civic artists have the same goals for their own work as [freespace] itself has: to lower the barriers to a fulfilled, engaged, creative life, so the community can benefit from the blooming bounties of a healthy culture.

I don’t know what we learned yet. But I don’t know what I’ve learned from the status quo yet, either. All I know is that I left [freespace] full of hope last night. For rest of June, [freespace] will be the setting for many portal stories.
