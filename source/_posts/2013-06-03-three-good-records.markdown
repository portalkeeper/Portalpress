José González has been my favorite singer/songwriter type for years, and the band pushes his style much further. His reedy voice and polygonal guitar playing are there in the middle, but on Junip records they swell with synths and strings and bass. Everything about it is percussive, so the drums begin to sound melodic.

I am studying this record. It seems to go with every situation. It's jammed full of dark, sweet songs, but inside each song is a vast space. They feel like places. I like to revisit them.

Favorite track: "So Clear"

<a href="http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr214">Nightmare Ending</a></center></h2>

I used to live in [Portland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon), which is a heavy place. The weather is heavy, the trees are heavy, the distant volcanoes are heavy, the river is heavy, the highways are heavy, the people are heavy. That's where I got into Eluvium, the music of Matthew Robert Cooper, who lives there.

This is his first record in a while, and the sound has grown. Eluvium tracks are always broad. They evolve slowly, they change clearly, they're like episodes. Pianos seem to drive his slow, moody compositions, but the new record brings them to the fore. You can hear the sounds of him making the music. There's even signing, a rare treat. I listen to *Nightmare Ending* at the end of the day.

Favorite track: "Happiness"

<h2><center>Autechre<br />

Autechre makes the world frantic, so when you feel frantic, things can still make sense. The sounds are made by computers, but they're twisted into the shapes of humans who are inundated by noises from computers. It's fast music. Your heart will race. Your mind will struggle. As it does.

Favorite track: "recks on"

This will be a rare type of Daily Portal post, I think, but I want to see if you like it. And I'd sure love to know what you think of these records if you listen to them, and I'll listen to anything else you recommend. [Write to me.](/about#contact)
