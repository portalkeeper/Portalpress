I know you did.

You can’t sit in this thing forever. That’s me telling myself, but I’m telling you, too. This portal is far out. You have to go back home and eat something. You have to wash your hair. You have to go for a walk! 

That’s what I’ve been doing. Going for a walk. When I don’t know what to do, I go for a walk, and when I don’t know where to go, I come to the portal.

Anyway, I’m back. I miss the feeling in here. It soothes me. Sometimes, I just have to lean back against the wall and listen.

Well, go on. What have you been doing while I was out? What have you been thinking about? Got any good stories?

Why don’t you keep the portal for a little while? I’ll be here. I want to listen. I’ve got a lot on my mind. I could use some distraction. It’s tiring, playing host all the time.

[Share your portal stories with me](/about#contact). I’ll edit them with you and publish them on the site. You can write out a whole story, send me photos, audio, or video, or even just write me a letter. We’ll come up with something.

I’ve brought a couple guest stories here with me to start you off. One’s [a happy story from my dad](/post/2013/07/23/guitar) about me as a baby. The other is [a sad story about a close cousin and a troubled bond](/post/2013/07/23/a-cousins-burden) sent to me by a portal visitor.

While you’re keeping the portal, I’ll make sure the lights stay on, and I’m going to think about a few other things. I’ll tell you more when I’ve got them figured out.

And sure, I’ll jump in with a story when there’s a lull.
