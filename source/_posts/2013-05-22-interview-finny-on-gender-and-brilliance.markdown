story_intro: "<strong>THIS INTERVIEW WITH</strong> <a href='http://ellipticallydirect.com/'>Finny</a>, an artist, writer, and game-maker I met through the Internet, is about gender. I wanted to ask Finny about gender after reading <a href='http://ellipticallydirect.com/?p=581'>this essay</a>. It is hard to think about. But try it. Remember, it's all a game. Don't forget, it's all real."

***The Daily Portal:** Where do you think gender and other identity roles come from? What's the balance of innate feeling and social/environmental factors that gives rise to such identities?*

**Finny:** I don't know how possible it is, if it is at all possible, to *see* the effects of biological factors in isolation or through any lens but culture. Without culture, gender would not exist.

Also, in [my essay, gender and brilliance](http://ellipticallydirect.com/?p=581), I go into depth about the constructions I discuss here, and my essay is evocative of the kind of anti-hegemonic way of thinking/writing I wish to see valued. So I really encourage you to read it.

I tend to think about patterns that fit behind phenomena, not roles per se. I call these patterns "maleness" and "femaleness" — ways of being that any person can experience regardless of their gender, fleetingly or for more sustained periods of time. I explain what these patterns look like in my essay, but to sum up:

• the foundation of maleness is the assumption: "i am and should be." maleness is like confidence, or entitlement.

• maleness distilled exists whenever (since it doesn't exist all the time) one knows himself/herself to be a person.

• maleness enables "the explicit." **it is also a culture, a culture of the illuminated, the visible.** maleness manifests in "seeing," "naming" and "doing," as these words are commonly understood. it is the means by which anything is done — the means by which a thought is thought, a piece is crafted, a scene is surveyed. it is language. it is whatever is acknowledged as common currency amongst human beings. maleness asks: "so what are you saying?" or "so what do you do with this?"

• femaleness is the reason for the doing. femaleness is reality. femaleness is anything that must be believed in **before** it is seen. it cannot and will not speak. it learns and speaks of itself only through maleness. it is the expanse of infinite possibility. it has no nature.

• the heart of female thinking is existing for another.

First, I am describing "maleness" and "femaleness" from a white, middle-class, perspective. I am a white cis women who grew up in a middle-class family. There are many different femininities and masculinities out there, and frankly, I've wondered why I'm even writing here because my voice is supported by [kyriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy). When I consider it though, I feel like my experience can help others who've struggled with self-esteem for the same reasons that I have.

It's important to parse something apart here. In mainstream US culture, the ineffable has become associated with the female. Women are considered intuitive rather than logical thinkers, mysterious, opaque, emotional. We need not make this connection because anyone has access to the ineffable, regardless of their gender. However since the cultural connection has been made so solidly, and because examinations of it so strongly go against the hegemonic male way of examining things, I group the ineffable and constructed feminine ways of being under the header of "femaleness."

I've been motivated to write about gender by the disparity I see between my own "brilliance," my particular brand of intelligence, and what is called intelligence by our society. I have always felt, even when I was a child, that there was something profoundly important yet by definition inarticulable that I needed to make the people around me aware of; this was, and is, female genius, or a way of being that is counter to maleness.

I remember one example from several years ago that kind of encapsulates the sort of frustrating interactions I would have. I was trying to explain the existence of femaleness to a friend of mine, and I said, "I don't think I'm getting this across." and he said "Well, I'm not confused." *To understand things in a male way is to be "not confused."* Femaleness is beyond words and beyond thinking. Nothing is a surer sign that you're not getting it than saying "I'm not confused."

It is obviously impossible to put all aspects of femaleness into words, but, in considering the way I think, some words do come to mind — structure, decaying, morphing, rising, connecting. Some conceptual truths, to me, are shimmering, shifting things that move in and out of the conscious mind, and memory often does not serve me well when I try to capture in words the experience of seeing these truths.

Why do I consider this kind of thinking to be "female?" I will explain the nature of my thinking in greater depth later, however, I will say now that I call it "female" for two reasons:

1․ It is anti-hegemonic, seemingly the antithesis of "logic" (though I do not believe it to be illogical); in other words, it is one "not male."

2․ It fits with what I understand the cultural construction of femaleness to be; this kind of thinking would be, to some, "mysterious," "opaque," "intuitive," and "emotional," though really, these assessments are from the male perspective and rather surface.

Again, this thinking is neither innate nor separate from culture.

Hegemonically, women are told they must master "male" thinking to be considered intelligent, special, capable human beings. That women must master male thinking shapes their thought processes as well as their senses of self. A woman may go through life never knowing that anything but the explicit, male way exists, while subconsciously wrestling with the existence of the ineffable, with which she has been or chooses to be aligned, the precursor to everything spoken. It is obvious then that women can feel cut off, can feel a burdensome and haunting disparity. They are also told that as women, they must master total unselfishness or the semblance of it. Thus women often have a lot more to master than cis men do.

So women can end up triply disadvantaged in the realm of excellence, and their self-esteem can suffer for it.

Firstly, their thought processes are sometimes not valued or deemed "intelligent."

Secondly, women are supposed to be as attentive to others' perspectives as possible, becoming collectors of perspectives and paradigms. This mass of information, held in the conscious or subconscious, can become unwieldy, manifesting as dullness or slowness when in fact it is diligent and thorough checking of facts against an expansive knowledge base.

Thirdly, women are supposed to drop everything (like a thought or project) in order to aid another, whether they deeply feel the need to or not. Cis men do not often share these burdens. I believe that women cluster around "mediocrity" in part for these reasons. I have experienced all of these things and talked to other women who have had similar experiences. I don't hope to prove anything to you, just to reach you if you've felt as I have, and to hear from you if you've felt differently (that is, if you're not here to deny or put down my experience). I hope to "resonate" with people, not convince them of anything through syllogism.

I was furious after seeing the graphic in Steven Pinker's lecture, the one I incorporate into [my essay](http://ellipticallydirect.com/?p=581), but I didn't know what to say to it.

It was just that sick feeling in my gut I get when something totally goes against my experience and perception of reality (and not in an eye-opening way). I was supposed to believe that women are just an inherently mediocre group of people, and men are the excellent. I was saddened by the fact that I couldn't formulate some kind of "analysis" to criticize this graphic. But that's the point and the trap. Femaleness is both an analysis in itself and an anti-analysis.

While I've talked a lot about femaleness and maleness as they can relate to bodies, it's important to say that these things exist as concepts separate from bodies, and femaleness itself is subjugated. Femaleness is not even undervalued, it is un-valued... even hated.

Maleness is taught in schools, femaleness is equated with stupidity.

Whenever Occam's Razor is held up to shut someone down, or thoughtful art is called "confused" or "incomplete," or a person is made to swallow another's truth though it goes against their own experience, femaleness is suppressed.

Femaleness is seen as kitschy, unserious, at best "cute."

Maleness is "legit," and respectable.

I could provide examples here, but it almost feels reductive to do so.

***TDP:** How are identity and expression/presentation connected?*

**Finny:** In my experience, identity and expression are in conversation. When we change ourselves "outwardly," or in some way act, we change our identities. For example, I used to worry a lot about being cowardly. When I started confronting things I was afraid of, I no longer considered myself a coward. It is as much that I "expressed" my capability for bravery as it was that I changed my identity and self-perception through action.

However, when it comes to gender — an aspect of identity that most often runs deep — it's not always best to look at identity as mutable. If gender identity were this super-malleable thing, people might not feel strongly about changing their bodies to fit their genders.

Of course, expression isn't perfectly mutable either (our bodies and minds can only change so much), and, since society's visions of "men" and "women" are rigid, it can be impossible or close to it to be/become the people we wish to be outwardly. I saw a [Louis Theroux documentary called *Under the Knife*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm5BqeBJCpc) about plastic surgery in LA, and in it, women were attempting to find emotional fulfillment through becoming physically exaggerated examples of the mainstream archetype "woman." The rigidity and elevation of gender archetypes makes comfort with our bodies and minds hard to achieve.

We can also play off the rigidity of gender. Archetypes can provide counterpoints for our expression, and can allow us to communicate. People communicate about themselves through androgynous or gender-ambiguous dress, drag, ultra-conformity, nondescript conformity, hyperbolic dress, etc.

***TDP:** How conscious a process is all this? Does it vary across the spectrum? If so, how?*

**Finny:** It can take a lot for a person to consciously align themselves with a gender or genders, though definitely not always. They must see themselves in relation to society and others. It took me a good while to realize that I wasn't just stupid or wrong vis-à-vis society, I was female.

Some people consciously align themselves with a gender or genders, binary and/or non-binary, because at some point they feel their genders are different from the ones imposed on them by society.

Some people are told they are "different," like, for example, when they are told they are "too" masculine or feminine for their imposed gender identities, regardless of whether they identify with their imposed gender identities. Such messages might influence a person's gender identity.

At the same time, a lot of people accept what they've been given gender-wise unquestioningly. We know this because so much essentialist writing exists, because our capitalist system successfully targets specific gendered consumers, and because *so many people never think about gender.*

Although I have never considered myself to be other than a woman, I have found exploring the meaning of gender, and my gender, helpful. In other words, I have found it helpful to consider myself in relation to my surroundings because it deepens my self-awareness.

***TDP:** How conscious do others have to be of one's identity and expression in order to be good to them? is that a lot to ask?*

Before I answer this question about ethics and the one that follows, I need to say a few things. I am not a perfect person, and I don't always know how to treat people well. Also, a person's gender constitutes only a part of their identity. So I discuss things in terms of identity rather than gender.

When I first meet a person, there are certainly ways I can be good to them. Looking for their good intentions, gendering them correctly, expressing interest in their thoughts and feelings, etc. And, I feel, letting my guard down enough to signal to them that I wish to be open, sincere.

However, should I wish to become close to someone, I would say I must *seek to be conscious of* their identity. I say "seek to be conscious of" because it can be a process. It's not as if I don't love someone if I don't fathom their perspective in its wholeness. It's more like a part of loving them is being willing to believe that they have a perspective worth understanding, likewise helping them to understand mine, and, risking my ego in the process.

A friend of mine used the words "talking to a person vs. talking through them." When I "talk to a person," I speak things that are relevant to their experience, and meant to be helpful to and/or enjoyed by them, whereas if I am "talking through them," I'm probably failing to understand that I'm interacting with a person beyond the borders of my interiority, and my words may or may not hit the mark.

At the same time, I think that a part of deepening relationships and being good to people is being true to who I am, which does not always require super-deep knowledge about the people with whom I'm engaging. When I confront my fears, take steps to process my feelings in the moment with the relevant people, or act out my eccentric desires/beliefs/well-meaning instincts, I can in the best scenario show people what is possible. I can inspire others and perhaps help them to become better people. This is also a way to do them justice.

I don't think it's a lot to ask that we exert ourselves for others' sakes. I can think of nothing more important.

***TDP:** Can role-playing and other kinds of games/entertainment help broaden our understanding of others and their identities?*

Yes, but, to what extent, I honestly don't know. There's so much information out there, everywhere we look, that can help us empathize with others. I don't think that games or entertainment are particularly special. I don't know that we need to read explicitly about others lives in order to gain empathy for them. Basically, I think that the willingness to empathize *precedes* exposure to information about others' lives. We must be willing and able to take in information before it can do us any good.
