I'm Jon. Welcome to the portal. I was just keeping it warm until you got here.

Let's talk. Got any stories? <a href="/about#contact">Let me know</a> if you do. I'm happy to go first, though.

We'll start with this story. What are we doing here? What is this thing with the purple walls where we've had the unbelievable fortune to meet?

This is The Daily Portal. It's a place to read stories. Every weekday (or so), I'll put out an issue of a few new stories about everyday life. They'll be true stories about people and relationships, work and play, art, science, design, and technology, with a little bit of spirituality sprinkled in. It's the stuff we're all thinking about lately.

While we're all out here at the portal, we might as well talk about life and try to figure some things out.

The Daily Portal is an outpost at the edge of the world. It's here for people who don't believe the fairy tales told in the nice, warm center where everything's all right. It's far out, it gets cold, and it might get lonely. But we can keep each other warm if we stick together.

I'll always [keep you posted](/season) on where I'm going and what I'm writing about next. That way, you can tune in for the parts that interest you. If you have a story, or an idea for a story, <a href="/about#contact">tell me</a>.

I'm still building this portal, testing things out, and working on the long-term parts of the plan. But it works, right? It's cozy enough. So make yourself comfortable and [stick around a while](/follow).

We've got a long night of portalkeeping ahead of us.
