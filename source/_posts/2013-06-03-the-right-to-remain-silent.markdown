Once again, I got sucked into the Silicon Valley vortex, seduced by the emotional high of never-ending networking for all. It's easy to believe in on the good days. But I forgot about silence! My friend Jori reminded me of that, and I felt like a dope.

Of course it's perfectly okay to be silent. We need rest. But there's so much noise in the world. Silence is hard to find. And as the crawling slime of media covers every surface of our daily lives in search of our precious attention, the world is getting louder.

But we go along with it. We bathe in the noise. We turn to noise for entertainment. We endure the noise of advertising in exchange for convenience. We tune in to streams of noise from our friends, so we feel less alone. We try to fill the silence.

Why do we waste time with inane babble like [the "How are you?" exchange](/post/2013/05/27/how-are-you)? Because it would seem rude to not say anything? I submit that it's more rude to ask someone to evaluate their state of being on the spot, and even more rude to make them lie if they don't want to talk about it.

I think we have internalized the notion that silence is empty space that must be filled. We act as if nothing happens in silence, as though we need to be constantly **doing something** in order to maximize our opportunities. Our conversations are like this. So are our media. It's all wrong.

I'd be happy to link you to some books or articles about how wrong this is, but the irony would go supernova. Unfathomable volumes of media have been created to describe the problem of unfathomable volumes of media. So let's just shut up for a second and use our intuition.

If our highest value is to *produce*, to *speak*, to produce endless novelty, endless stimulation, the quality suffers. If our highest value is to create *meaning*, then we will avoid making too much noise. Which of those worlds sounds healthier to you?

I make lots of noise. I make noise because I think I have to, or else no one will notice me. The online media world where I've found myself working is built to make me worry about this. I know [the toll it takes on me](http://readwrite.com/2012/10/25/confessions-of-a-professional-internet-addict), but I constantly forget.

I'm failing to keep the portal when I forget that. I'm not keeping a connection open, I'm filling it with empty noise.

It took until [Issue 7](/post/2013/05/27/how-are-you) for me to explain what The Daily Portal's mission is. It's to open the portals between people, so they can better know each other and work together.

But **an open portal does not preclude silence.** Few moments of portalkeeping are more profound than those in which the words dry up, and people just look at each other, connected and silent.

The part I left out of last issue is even more important. "When we're together, we have a moral responsibility to keep our portals open," I [wrote](/post/2013/05/27/how-are-you/) last week, and it's a good thing I began with that caveat about "when we're together." **We can't keep our portals open all the time.** We need time alone to recover, to process, and to let our guard down.

That need for isolation is what drove me [out to the Turquoise Portal](/post/2013/05/13/2012-keeping-the-portal/) in the first place. To be sure, The Daily Portal stands for that, too.

The right to a shared reality must be guaranteed for all, but the right to disconnect shall not be infringed.
