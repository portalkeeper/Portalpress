So I wanted to do the best top 5 list I could possibly do. I hope you can tell that it took me more than 45 minutes, which is usually all bloggers paid by the page view have to spend on something. I was one of those once. [This issue](/issue/11), which I’ve been working on alongside a bunch of other things for about three weeks, was an act of atonement.

It was also an act of high Internet. Remember weblogs? Remember when web culture consisted entirely of people putting intense care and craft into their own opinions and posting them on their websites? We can still do that, you know. We just need to chill out about judging each other’s efforts.

Chill out, man.

U mad? I propose this: If you don’t like my list, write your own post and call it Top 5 Rock Records Of All Time. Let Google sort it out.

If you do, please, *please* [tell me about it](/about#contact). I want to listen to your top five records, and I want to know why you love them.
