My friends are throwing it, and I'm helping out in a few ways. I don't want to talk too much about it, but I'll say this: It's shaping up to be pretty aesthetically significant.

As incredibly douche-y as that sounds, what I mean is that I expect some stories to come out of this weekend that speak of something really new happening. I'm attending primarily to enjoy that new thing happening, but I'll report back.

Among other significant conversations I plan to have, [Harlan Emil Gruber the portalmaker](/post/2013/05/07/who-built-this/#harlan) will be there, along with one of his portals. So when I get back, we'll have an inaugural Daily Portal interview with the portalmaker.

Barring any unforeseen chaos, of course.
