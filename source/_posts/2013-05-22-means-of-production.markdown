story_intro: "<strong>GAME WORLDS MATTER</strong> to me, as we established in <a href='http://thedailyportal.com/issue/4/'>Issue 4</a>. But it was the recent discovery of a certain way of seeing, making, and playing games that revealed to me how often the Real World is like a game."

Last year, I read this incredible article called [Creation Under Capitalism and the Twine Revolution](http://nightmaremode.net/2012/11/creation-under-capitalism-23422/) that cracked my mind open. It showed me how tight the border is between Game and Reality, and it showed me the power that creative people could wield by seizing the means of production of games. Do not pass 'Go.' [Read it](http://nightmaremode.net/2012/11/creation-under-capitalism-23422/) and come back.

The game-building tool at the center of the article is called [Twine](http://aliendovecote.com/?page_id=4047). It lets you make hypertext games that can play differently every time. They're like [5-dimensional](http://imaginingthetenthdimension.blogspot.com/2008/05/fifth-dimension-isnt-magic.html) stories, in which you can read all the outcomes by choosing them yourself. Games like this make it pretty easy for the player to imagine a situation from multiple perspectives, which can do a number on their identity and teach them about themselves. It's deliciously subversive if you let it be. Want to dive into Twine games? Check out [TwineHub](http://twinehub.weebly.com/).

I followed [Porpentine](https://twitter.com/aliendovecote), author of the article, to see what else I could learn about Twine games and storytelling, and that's how I found [At the Bonfire](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6923686/bonfire.html) a Twine game by [Finny](https://twitter.com/elstephs). The situation in the game felt so strongly familiar, and it was such a short text, really. It was packed with power. [Play the game](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6923686/bonfire.html) to see what I mean.

I contacted Finny after that to ask about Twine, and we struck up a conversation about games, patterns, characters, and gender, one of the trickiest games in Real Life.

That's when I discovered Finny's "gender and brilliance" essays. These untangle and examine so many power games we play constantly under the guise of gender, that gripping illusion. More importantly, they tease apart gender roles — these prescribed jobs, traits, and behaviors we learn from our social environment — from the male and female tendencies that arise from our biological environment. So many well-meaning discussions of gender fail to do this. The essays left me with more questions, which Finny answered in an [interview in this issue](/post/2013/05/22/interview-finny-on-gender-and-brilliance).

If you want more depth on Finny's language about gender before or after you read [the Daily Portal interview](/post/2013/05/22/interview-finny-on-gender-and-brilliance), read the "gender and brilliance" essays below:

<h2><center><a href="http://ellipticallydirect.com/?p=581">gender and brilliance</a></center></h2>

> "great femaleness requires greater than great maleness to be made visible. like now, for example, i see each word of this piece as alive, as moving. i see (literally, in images) the potential greatness of the piece increasing with every word i put down while, by the same action, the possibility of realizing that greatness decreases. i see spiraling, pillar-like structures shooting up. the higher the structure, the greater the significance. but i know that in order to render that significance intelligible, at a certain point i will have to disallow the growth of these pillars, so that i can build bridges amongst them and to what is readily apparent."

<h2><center><a href="http://ellipticallydirect.com/?p=2343">gender and brilliance II</a></center></h2>

> "Why discuss this subject? For me it’s about helping myself and others find self-esteem and a sense of appreciation for the beauty of their own minds in a world that would have them feel pathetic, weak, dull."
