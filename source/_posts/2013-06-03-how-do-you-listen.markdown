I’m figuring out how to write about music on The Daily Portal. I think I’ve established [why I want to](http://thedailyportal.com/post/2013/05/27/the-reach-of-words/). Music is the other half of psychic communication, if you ask me. We can't understand each other with words alone.

But you people signed up for words, so I figure we ought to take it slow on the body language.

So, as I was working on musical projects last week, I sounded out the people receiving TDP transmissions about their musical habits. “How do you listen to music these days?” I asked on the various social networks. The responses taught me a whole lot about who’s listening.

I am acutely aware of the slant in my audience toward tech/media types. But I was still surprised by the overwhelming extent to which my question, “How do you listen to music these days?” was interpreted to mean, “What software do you use to listen to music these days?”

What about albums versus songs? What kinds of speakers do you use? In which media and formats do you keep your music? What combinations of new and old music do you listen to in this ahistorical artistic age of the 2010s? But almost all the replies were just names of music-streaming applications that have commercials.

Jarrod Valentine was the one person who replied that he still listens to entire albums (God bless him).

[Drew Coffman wrote](https://alpha.app.net/drewcoffman/post/6240677) about smart playlists he uses to make sure he’s hearing all his new tunes and keeping track of the ones he likes:

My dad, clever guy that he is, [remarked](https://www.facebook.com/TheDailyPortal/posts/467811856631759?comment_id=3280715&offset=0&total_comments=3) that he listens to music “con mis orejas.”

And, honestly, my favorite answer was this:

The rest of the answers were all about which streaming music rental service people prefer. That concerns me. I won't go into why, though my concerns are [well documented elsewhere](http://readwrite.com/2012/09/13/screw-the-new-ipods-we-need-better-music-players). But this information is enormously valuable to me. Now I know that, in order to talk about music here, we have to deal with technology.

To begin writing about music on The Daily Portal, [I'll recommend some records](/post/2013/06/03/three-good-records/).
