story_intro: "<strong>AN OLD FRIEND'S</strong> wedding is a valuable opportunity to check in. Last weekend, I went to the first one of those in my life. Seems like I’m heading into a pretty heavy season of firsts."

The groom, K, was a friend of mine from middle school. I met the bride, E, one college summer when he and I lived together in Boston. They met at their freshman orientation. She’s been part of the tribe for a long time, and we were all so glad to be there for the start of their family.

For K’s birthday that summer in Boston, I bought him one of my favorite books of poetry, which they enjoyed together. E picked out [one of the poems](/post/2013/05/20/some-fill-with-each-good-rain) for me to read at the ceremony, which I was honored to do. We also sang a lot together at the wedding. It was a joyous occasion.

This tribe of mine, largely a high school tribe on the groom’s side, has stayed wonderfully close, considering that many of us are scattered around the world far from [Atlanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta), where we grew up. But I mean this in an almost entirely virtual sense. We rarely get to see each other in the flesh. So this wedding was a reunion, too.

But intellectually, we’re always together, especially when we disagree. We met each other by learning together, and we’ll never stop. Throughout the wedding, even when we were halfway unconscious (alcohol is such a silly drug), we were bouncing new and old ideas off of one another. A bunch of these conversations produced threads for great portal stories, which you’ll see here as soon as I can write them. [One of them](/post/2013/05/20/daniel-keeps-the-portal) went a long way toward shaping The Daily Portal itself.

We hear a lot about the problems with marriage in the U.S. these days. It’s interesting how often they’re blamed on marriage *itself*, as an institution, rather than other social pressures on the people who get married. Now that I mention it, my generation gets a lot of shade thrown at it about what’s wrong with our world and how doomed we are. I’m grateful to K and E for standing up to that, bringing so many of us together in the process.

Congratulations to the bride and groom and both of their families. You inspire us.
