story_intro: "<strong>K FOUND ME</strong> at the bar. I was leaning against it with E, smoking, discussing how we negotiate the choppy waters of family. K's eyes were vast, her words gushed like spring water, her pink wig crackled with laser light. She wanted me to come with her."

We ran up the hill, through the forest, holding hands. She was taking me to the portal. She had to give me something. It had to happen there.

We saw the glowing teahouse through the trees. We passed the campfire. We wound around the water tanks and generators, ducked under the chinquapin trees. There was the portal. It throbbed deeply.

We sat on the blue carpet, leaned against the resonating red core, saw ourselves doubly in the two triangular mirrors. K had written a poem. It was for me. It had been coming for days. She didn't know what it was until it was done. It was scrawled across many pages. She was afraid to begin. It was hard to read.

She leaned against me, cupped her hand to my ear, and began to whisper.
