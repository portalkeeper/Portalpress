They couldn’t even name this record. Or wouldn’t. Didn’t have to. It was carved permanently into everybody as soon as it came out.

When “Black Dog” starts, you can’t even see the distance between Zeppelin and the rest of the pack as far as musicianship. It sounds so natural and funky and raw — because they’re so tight — that it doesn’t occur to you how utterly unable any other band would be to play this. What *is* that guitar solo at the end? It gets all over everything.

Track 2 is “Rock And Roll,” the song.

And then “The Battle Of Evermore” makes it otherworldly. This is where Zeppelin opens up for the first time in their career. They’ve done sensitive songs before, but this is more than that. From here on out on the fourth record, Zeppelin has a folklore, a mythology. It shows us who they really are.

It’s endearing. But admit it: it weakens the music.

Yes, I’m talking about “Stairway To Heaven.” My roommate, Sarah — who stayed up until 4:30 AM with me during one of my listening sessions for [this list](/issue/11) — says I should just skip over “Stairway” without mentioning it, but I can’t do that.

I can’t not talk about “Stairway To Heaven.” It was the first song I ever learned. “Stairway To Heaven” made a 13-year-old boy from Atlanta, Georgia ask his dad for a guitar. There are probably millions of others like me.

But listen to it now. It doesn’t stand up. It’s not just that it’s “overplayed.” That doesn’t exist. If something can be “overplayed,” it must not be great enough. It’s a nerdy song. “Misty Mountain Hop” is a *really* nerdy song. “Four Sticks” is a music-nerdy song. And if you know me at all, you know I mean “nerdy” as a compliment. I am a nerd and lover of nerds. But our nerdiness and our rock and roll are tendencies at odds with each other.

That said…

“Going To California.” I wrote a whole story about this song when I was a teenager. I looked all over for it while I was writing this. Couldn’t find it. But look how I ended up. It came true, mostly.

And just as Zeppelin did, I’ll leave you with this: “When The Levee Breaks” has the most important drums of all time.
