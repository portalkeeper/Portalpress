story_intro: "<strong>THE DAILY PORTAL</strong> is a seasonal site. The coverage will be planned in seasons that last a month or two, and they'll be pre-announced, so you can see what's in store. That doesn't mean there won't be stories between seasons, though."

Right now, this is a preseason. I'll still be posting issues some weekdays. But the volume will be lower, and the stories will be more one-off features, rather than episodes of one or more days that tie together.

This first preseason will contain a lot of experiments. For one thing, I'm still building features of the site I'll need before Season 1. I also want to try out different kinds of stories to see what works and what doesn't. So thanks for being here for the beginning of this thing. Got ideas or feedback? <a href="/about#contact">Write to me</a>.

I'm going to leave this first issue up for a few days, so it's easier for people to figure out what The Daily Portal is about. But I have some great stories for the next few issues. Stay tuned.
