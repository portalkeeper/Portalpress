story_intro: "<strong>I ASKED PROTEUS</strong> developer Ed Key about the technical and artistic reasons Proteus is an island."

***The Daily Portal:** Is Proteus an island so it stands alone? Or are you — like I am — drawn to The (archetypal) Island over and over?*

**Ed Key:** Well, just to get the boring pragmatic reason out of the way first: Making anything *other than* an island would require either glass walls to restrict the world (horrible!) or streaming technology and a design for an endless world or huge continent. An island was a natural choice because it's possible to create a small, fairly dense space that it's possible to become a little familiar with whilst exploring it. So, I guess that is: "Yes, so that it stands alone!"

However the image of an island is incredibly resonant with me too. I was always fascinated by tiny rocky islands in lakes — just a few trees, big enough to imagine hidden nooks and crannies there.

Here's a good one that I've driven past several times:

I guess there's a kind of bonsai tree-like quality: A microcosm of the natural world around it, that feels like it's small enough to hold in your hand.

***TDP:** How, in your words, does Proteus, the island, change? What's different when you come back again? What's familiar? What does that "wilder generation" switch in the preferences do? Feel free to be as poetic or as technical as you want to about this.*

**EK:** When you come to a new island, it's mostly just the layout that's changing. The same plants, animals and landmarks get stirred around in a different way. You tend to get some different juxtapositions of elements, like squirrels frolicking in the graveyard, but it's fairly subtle. The thing that changes most surprisingly is the shapes of the hills. You might get a particularly nice tranquil valley, or an imposing, mythical-looking hill, or an unwelcoming cliff at the point you come aground. The "wilder generation" is really subtle — it just loosens the parameters a bit, but it doesn't do a huge amount.

It's hard for me to tell how much people enjoy these variations, but I had a weird feeling around the start of this year when I started seeing islands in videos and screenshots and realising that I'd never be able to visit that place.

Here's an example that I found particularly strong:

<div class="flex-video">
  <iframe width="100%" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1rW_n2FhWms" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

It's probably just something that happened to me after a stressful time around the launch.. I don't really expect any players to feel that way!
