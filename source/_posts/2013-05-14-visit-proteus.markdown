I have always been drawn to islands. They are isolated, which can be lonely, but isolation provides security and coherence. All an island’s territory can be known. The boundaries are obvious. Surely, that is *not* what life is like. But that’s why an island vacation can be such a relief, provided you don’t spend it all mentally on the mainland.

My first island was [Myst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst). It was also my first CD-ROM, which is a data island. But the virtual island of Myst — and the other islands radially linked to it through its book portals — became a home to me. I learned every corner of it. I would return to the same spots again and again just to hear how the wind whistled there. The island was so knowable to me that I could revisit it in my mind whenever I needed to get away.

Twenty years later, I first visited [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/). That island was alive. Time passed, seasons changed, critters took me by surprise. But it took me right back to the same internal island I remembered from Myst. It was more like visiting the same place, only *I* had changed. I had grown up, so I noticed the passage of time and the changing of seasons more accutely. I noticed how beautiful the flowers were. And when I went back again, I noticed that the island, while always familiar, is never the same twice.

[Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) generates a musical island every time you go there. You walk ashore, get the lay of the land, and live out a whole year before you leave. You have to look at and listen to everything to learn your way around. The nights are beautiful there.

In this issue of The Daily Portal, you’ll get a [tour of the island](/post/2013/05/14/journal-from-the-island) I saw when I visited the first time. You’ll also get to hear from its creators, developer [Ed Key](/post/2013/05/14/interview-proteus-developer-ed-key) and composer [David Kanaga](/post/2013/05/14/interview-proteus-composer-david-kanaga), about what drew them to the island. Finally, I’ve made a list of my [five favorite virtual islands](/post/2013/05/14/top-5-virtual-islands). I’d love to hear about your favorite islands, too, especially if [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) becomes one of them. [Drop me a message in a bottle.](/about/#contact)
