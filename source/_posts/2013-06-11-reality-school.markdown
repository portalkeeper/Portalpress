I’d like to think I share their lofty, noble goal, but I must admit that I’m rather short on practical ideas. I figure the next best thing is to situate myself in the middle of a bunch of driven world-savers, so that I might learn something.

It’s a behavior not unlike one my friends and I invented in high school. When we learned about [osmosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis) in sophomore biology, we all started putting our heads down on our desks, balancing our textbooks on our ears, and trying to empty our minds of knowledge, so all the test material would just flow in.

It would be an oversimplification to say that it didn’t work. Clearly, we *did* learn something from this trick. It may not have been the rote memorization of facts we needed to recall for the test, but we surely internalized some kind of understanding. We learned to laugh at biology jokes.

So far, I’d say that about describes what I’ve learned from the millennial messiahs in my social circles, too. Our jokes about saving the world have gotten very funny. We make Bush jokes, Obama jokes, wiretapping jokes, drone jokes, Drug War jokes, climate change jokes, democracy jokes, capitalism jokes, Singularity jokes, apocalypse jokes, Burning Man jokes, and — by far the richest subject matter available to us — [Silicon Valley jokes](https://twitter.com/NextTechBlog).

Clearly, we haven’t passed the test yet. But lots of people laugh at our jokes.

It’s with this sense of humor that I have approached <a href='http://freespace.io'>[freespace]</a>, the month-long experiment in Millennial world-saver values that has plopped down south of Market in San Francisco this June. I wrote about my first impressions in [Issue 9](http://thedailyportal.com/issue/9), and now I’ve had about a week to develop an impression.

Exactly how this 14,000-foot piece of prime SF real estate came to be rented to these misfits for $1 this month is a puzzle I’m still trying to piece together. I’ve heard it told a few different ways so far, and I’m not yet ready to report it conclusively. But here’s what I know.

The pitch to the owners and the city worked. The [freespace] organizers are driven by the pure, Burning Man-inspired intention to show the world that economics of abundance, guaranteeing the basic human needs for shelter and community, can produce a better society than scarcity and competition. They’re living up to their promises to let anyone in who passes by and to make sure everyone inside knows they’re supported.

(Though they are occasionally slipping on the no-alcohol policy. I saw two infractions, both by Burnery people who looked like they felt entitled to their beers.)

But [freespace] is clearly seeded by hand-wavey future-of-everything people in the professional innovation industry. There’s something called [Innovation Endeavors](http://innovationendeavors.com/) involved in some capacity, and Google’s Eric Schmidt is a founding partner. I’ve heard the names of more than one massive tech company thrown around as though they’re looking to be involved in some way. The momentum behind [freespace] reeks of Silicon Valleyness. But I sure didn’t see anybody like that doing the jellyfish parade with us at [last weekend’s BurnerHack event](http://blog.burningman.com/2013/06/afield-in-the-world/burnerhack-freespace/).

I relay the above to you without any moral content, and I have much more to learn about what it means. I just think it’s a noteworthy contrast to the appearance of the place.

As far as I can tell, no matter how they’re funded, the [freespace] idea comes from a solid bunch of the kind of world-saver people with whom I’ve tried to surround myself. I was one degree of separation from the gaggle of Burners who pulled [freespace] together, and now I’m zero. I have a great deal in common with them. The most important commonality is a shared belief that an experiment like this will do… *something* good.

But it’s week two, and [freespace] is still kind of a playground. The team has some great events planned, like [tonight’s art opening](https://www.facebook.com/events/377736105663704/) for the murals there, which should give more shape to the place. But while I’m at [freespace], I can’t shake the feeling that nobody in the neighborhood knows what’s going on at 1131 Mission Street. And many of those people would be a lot better off if their rent were only $1 this month. Or if they could spend a couple nights inside. But [freespace] closes every night.

But we’re doing something. That’s for sure. When we figure out what it is, we’re sure you’ll thank us.

*If you’re interested in supporting [freespace], it has launched [an indiegogo campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/freespace-a-temporary-space-for-lasting-change--5) to cover its rent to stay open through July. Whether the one-month experiment changes the world or not, keeping [freespace] going for longer only makes it more likely to have an impact. Also, it probably keeps some horrible retailer out of the space.*
