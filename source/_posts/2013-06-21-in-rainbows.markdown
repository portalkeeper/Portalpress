One time, I was listening to this record, and in the middle of “Jigsaw Falling Into Place,” when he sings, “The beat goes round and round. The beat goes round and round,” my head became the needle of a record player held precisely between my Grado headphones. The groove was under me, and the whole planet revolved around me like a long-playing record.

I know, right? Radiohead. Hilarious. But that didn’t occur to me until a day later. At the time, I was just listening. I had always wanted a record to do that to me, and it finally did.

*In Rainbows* starts on the surface. “Et cetera, et cetera.” Thom Yorke exactly as he is. It couldn’t be any more of a self-aware throwaway line, and Radiohead fans still adore it, and that’s the the joke. Meanwhile, the guitar adventure that takes this record such great distances is packing its bags the whole time. The bass is revved up. The kiddies are enjoying the game.

Then you’re dropped off into track 2, which is where Radiohead always puts the mission statement. And “Bodysnatchers” is why Radiohead made this list.

Listen to those guitars scraping, chomping, waiting to play. And then they let them go.

> “I’VE NO IDEA WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT.   
> I’M TRAPPED IN THIS BODY, CAN’T GET OUT.”

“It is the 21st century.” And *In Rainbows* is the only record on [the list](/issue/11) from it.

When that squall of guitars is over, the needle drops on “Nude,” which I can barely even talk about. On the record before this, Radiohead did a song called “Sail To The Moon.” “Nude” was written years before it, but “Sail To The Moon” was released first. And it was nearly as beautiful. But it was clothed.

> “You’ll go to hell   
> for what your dirty mind   
> is thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Listen to that note. Listen to how it holds and then bends, just so, so slightly.

> iiiinking.”

Humans made this.

As heavenly as it sounds, you know humans made this. Every single squeak of every single finger on every single string on every single guitar on this entire record is right there, buzzing in your fingertips. Every piece falls right into place.

Radiohead made the latest great rock record of all time, the best one since the ’70s. It’s because they arrived at the peak of technology, so it could finally be expressed and captured like this.

It’s dedicated to all human beings.

Humans made this.

And when they’re at the Pearly Gates, this will be on their videotape.
