story_intro: "<strong>AT THE LOBBY</strong> bar, after the wedding party and the unruly bus ride back from it, I had a pivotal conversation with a childhood friend, the documentarian <a href='http://dschwaz.com/'>Daniel Schwartz</a>, whose work I expect to continue admiring for many years."

He challenged me to describe The Daily Portal's project, and he challenged me hard. [His work](http://dschwaz.com/) explores the influence of urban places on groups of people. He and [Urban-Think Tank](http://www.u-tt.com/) — the Zurich-based organization where he works — use media and design to impress upon all of us the importance of urban forces, which disproportionately affect less powerful people. What do I do?

Good question, Schwaz.

I trotted out a few answers that were variously about fixing problems with publishing — a mostly technical, expert-level concern — and sharing cool people, work, and experiences with you all, which felt much closer to couch-bound entertainment than fixing problems, at least when I explained it drunkenly in the hotel lobby. But through the gauntlet of excellent questions, I think I landed on something pretty good.

I am an adoring fan of the kind of work [U-TT](http://www.u-tt.com/) does to improve our planetary sense of space, function, and the dynamics of groups of people. We need a lot of help with that. Have you seen, like, buildings? They're almost universally awful, and not just aesthetically. There is no "just aesthetically" in architecture or environmental design. These are our habitats. They shape our society. We don't want those to be awful. They need to be constructed with love and care.

Guiding the design of our habitats is surely one way writing about the future can help people.

But at The Daily Portal, I am writing about the other way. I am writing about our *internal, individual* environment. I am writing about *what it's like* to be us. I don't think the balance between nature and design is much different between the world around us and our own minds. We need just as much love and care for our own psychology as we do for our ecology.

As the texts in my collection of [introductory portal readings](http://thedailyportal.com/post/2013/05/07/portal-readings/) explain, the distinction between psychology and ecology is, at most, just one of perspective. They both, together, constitute our environment.

I will keep reading and digesting what people write, say, and film about our external environment, so I can stay informed about the world around me. I will write about what it's like to be there from as many perspectives as I possibly can.

As for Daniel, I am hoping to publish a story of his here soon. I haven't even read it yet, but I know you're going to like it.
