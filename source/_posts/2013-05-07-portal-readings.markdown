story_intro: "<strong>THERE’S A CONSTELLATION</strong> of ideas I’ve been staring at in wonder as I’ve assembled The Daily Portal. Eventually, I’ll have my own words to describe them. But here at the beginning, I’m mostly using and remixing useful terms I’ve learned from other people."

These are five texts that have helped, organized under broad themes. There are many more, and I find more every day, often by some of these same authors. Sharing and discussing them with you is part of why I made this portal. If you want a crash course in the Daily Portal perspective here at the beginning, I recommend these readings.
<hr />

<center><h2>Mindset</h2></center>

<p><center><strong><a href="http://www.ecobuddhism.org/wisdom/psyche_and_spirit/james_hillman/">A Psyche the Size of the Earth</a></strong><br />
James Hillman</center></p>

Breaking open the ego. Moving towards a psychology that accounts for the fuzzy lines between ourselves and the world.

> “In brief, if psychology is the study of the subject, and if the limits of this subject cannot be set, then psychology merges willy-nilly with ecology.”
<hr />

<center><h2>Embodiment</h2></center>

<p><center><strong><a href="http://www.meltingasphalt.com/ethology-and-personal-identity/">Ethology and Personal Identity</a></strong><br />
Kevin Simler</center></p>

Putting personal identity under the microscope. Discovering that identity is connective tissue between personality and the world. Realizing that the body lives not on the personality side but on the world side.

> “In the nature vs. nurture debate, everyone knows it’s not one or the other, but some ‘mixture’ or interaction between the two. This is my proposal for what that interaction is. Nature negotiates with nurture, and the resulting territory determines who we are.”
<hr />

<center><h2>Vision</h2></center>

<p><center><strong><a href="http://www.billemory.com/dillard/dillard.html">This Is the Life</a></strong><br />
Annie Dillard</center></p>

Sneaking around the walls of culture and politics. Trying to see what the world is like without our learned simplifications holding us back.

> “Who is your ‘everyone’? Chess masters scarcely surround themselves with motocross racers. Do you want aborigines at your birthday party? Or are you serving yak-butter tea? Popular culture deals not in its distant past, or any other past, or any other culture. You know no one who longs to buy a mule or be named to court or thrown into a volcano.”
<hr />

<center><h2>Work</h2></center>

<p><center><strong><a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/2012/10/10/rejects-of-the-job-economy/">Finding Value in the Rejects of the Job Economy</a></strong><br />
Nick Meador</center></p>

Admitting that “job,” “work,” and “a living” are all words that need redefinition now, for economic and humane reasons. The longer we wait to redefine these most real-life of concerns, the harder it will be for our economy to “recover” in any meaningful sense.

> “This fight is not against work, but against *meaningless* work – whether meaningless to the individual, or meaningless to the collective culture. … Unless one is capable of staying in what our society has deemed a ‘normal’ state of consciousness for 20-40 hours per week week after week, one cannot ‘make a living.’”
<hr />

<center><h2>Society</h2></center>

<p><center><strong><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/05/09/welcome-to-the-future-nauseous/">Welcome to the Future Nauseous</a></strong><br />
Venkatesh Rao</center></p>

Dissolving the manufactured normalcy field. Examining how the future comes on constantly without ever arriving, giving us motion sickness.

> “We aren’t being hit by Future Shock. We are going to be hit by Future Nausea. You’re not going to be knocked out cold. You’re just going to throw up in some existential sense of the word. I’d like to prepare. I wish some science fiction writers would write a few nauseating stories.”
