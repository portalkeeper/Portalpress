story_intro: "<strong>STEVE KENNA WAS</strong> my first cousin. I’ve had twelve first cousins, all of whom I regard with affection, but as with most families, life and circumstance ensure that all is not equal on the family tree."

Steve was, as such things turn out, first among my firsts.

We were born a year apart to the week. Our personalities, however, would never provide support for our astrological kinship. Steve was gregarious, confident, capable, ambitious, and funny. I was the one with self-esteem problems — the “quiet” one. What brought us together were our mothers. Both were beautiful and intelligent. Both had married well, in a time when a woman’s station in life was usually a reflection of her husband’s status. Both were also destined to be lifelong alcoholics, to end their marriages relatively quickly, and to slide inexorably toward sad endings. It was within the dysfunctional dynamic of their alcohol dependence that Steve and I forged our bond. Much of that bonding took place on boats.

Steve got his first boat, an eight-foot aluminum pram, when he was ten. His last, a thirty-eight foot Bertram sport-fisherman, came at fifty. I spent time with him on all of them. Here is one time, as vivid in my memory today as on the day it took place, fifty-one summers ago.

I’m behind Gypsy III, cutting back and forth on a red slalom ski. The milky blur of the wake, shot through with dark greens and frothy browns, runs under my ski as we pass to the east of Faulkner’s Island and head off in the general direction of Long Island’s north shore, lying hazily on the horizon across the Sound. I’m fifteen and believe fervently that water skiing with my cousin Steve is as good as life gets.

Steve is driving. This is before a third person was required to observe, so he drives with one hand on the throttle and one on the wheel, his body canted sideways in the seat to keep an eye on me. As I exit a turn, a translucent wall of spray trailing behind me, and set-up to fling myself back across the wake, I see Steve suddenly let go of the steering wheel and reach for his head with both hands. I immediately straighten out and watch. Steve shakes his head, as if trying to clear it, stands, and then lurches to the rear of the boat, barely stopping himself from falling overboard by grabbing onto the outboard engine. Stunned, I watch as he woozily rises, stares blankly in my direction and, without a word, falls backwards into the Sound.

In the half-second it takes to sweep past him, I get a blurred glimpse of his head and a feebly raised hand before he sinks out of sight. I turn forward to face an empty boat heading briskly and dispassionately toward Long Island, fifteen miles away. When I next look back, Steve is gone.

Fuck. I’m near panic, but somehow hold it together. Do I let go of the tow rope and swim after him? He’s already a hundred yards behind me. I’ll never spot him from the water—and what would I do if I did? We’re almost two miles offshore. Plus, I’d be abandoning the boat, which is almost always a bad decision inviting a worse outcome. I’ll just have to pull myself hand-over-hand along the tow rope until I’m close to the boat and then kick out of my ski while making a desperate lunge for the transom. What if my legs swing down into the prop? I try to put that thought out of my mind and begin dragging myself forward, praying I won’t fall.

I struggle to within six feet of the stern and am trying to summon the nerve to take that ‘one shot’ leap when the engine coughs and dies. Somewhere in the back of my head pieces begin falling into place, but I ignore them. I swim to the boat and clamber over the gunwale. I’m shaking from the adrenaline, but I’m safe. I’m not going to drown today. I won’t end up a bloody mess like that poor snorkeler in the local dive shop poster who surfaced under a running outboard. And I still have a shot at saving Steve. I quickly haul in the tow rope and yank the starter cord. Nothing. After two more pulls, I reach down to squeeze the rubber priming bulb on the fuel line and realization floods in.

Steve has disconnected the line. The engine has run out of gas. I mentally flip through the fresh sequence of images. Steve grabbing his head. Steve standing and stumbling to the back of the boat. Steve collapsing over the engine (while at the same time reaching down to unhook the gas line). Steve falling silently overboard and waving “goodbye” as he lets himself sink under the waves. You prick, I say aloud. I keep saying this over and over as I start the engine and walk forward to the controls, but by then, I’m smiling as I curse.

It was an Oscar-worthy performance. It’s also familiar territory: just another set-up by my cousin that drives home, through inventive example, the true meaning of the phrase “having fun at someone else’s expense.” This happens to be a specialty of Steve’s. But it may be more accurate to label it, from the perspective of the recipient, an expression of sublimated anger masquerading as humor. And though it is as hard not to forgive him as it is easy to love him, I’m already thinking about how long I should let him tread water.

Like every child who bears the burden of living with an alcoholic parent, the idea that the fate of our mothers awaited either of us was simply unthinkable. Certainly, that was true in the summer of our fifteenth and sixteenth years as we skied off the beach at Steve’s uncle’s home in Madison, Connecticut, or talked late into the night about where our lives might take us. Those warm summer evenings held nothing but promise. In Steve’s case, that promise led through all of the expected “successes” — good schools, a beautiful wife, handsome children and a steadily advancing career — to a small hotel room in Vermont, where, at age fifty-six, he put down his burden, locked the door and drank himself to death.
