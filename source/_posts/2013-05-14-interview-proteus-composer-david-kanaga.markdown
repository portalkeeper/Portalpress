***The Daily Portal:** How different was making a musical island from the music you usually make?*

**David Kanaga:** Well, I make a lot of different kinds of music, and when I was working on Proteus, the form was dynamic, liquid in a way, but I was very conscious of making it well-shaped within that framework, like an album, a relatively stable music object. At the same time, when I make music objects, fixed 'lines' of music-information, I'm typically trying to open it up, to liquefy it as much as possible, to play it as one possible flow of a virtual space which sort of extends outside the piece itself. So, I'm trying to find how music spaces are objects, and how the objects are spaces, and to explore the flows, the play, of all of this.

To answer the question, then, it was a similar process, at least in a broad sense. Of course, there is way more iteration needed when making a videogame, and that has an impact on working patterns, just the practicality of making something that's built with code, too, even tho I didn't have to touch that, the delayed time-aspect makes it more distanced from raw impulse.. that time-abstraction is the 'music design' aspect, music design is necessary in videogames, but of course music design happens in composition, too, the architectural aspect of music is always there.

***TDP:** I have a feeling that composing music is always a little bit like making an island. It's a self-contained environment with clear beginnings and ends, right? The more complete a work it is, the more the listenerinhabits it, kind of literally. Do you agree or disagree with any of this? How do you think about the relationship between music and place?*

**DK:** Right, very much so, though clear beginnings and ends are an interesting thing to try to smudge up a bit...

Music and place, there's a very real parallel here, moving through spaces. the interesting thing about music, is that the 'grounds' and 'walls' of the places can be in constant motion, so the architectures that you're exploring really are made out of malleable materials. There's some crazy things in architecture happening these days, they talk about working with 'form-finding materials' sometimes, but even dynamic architectures are much slower than music (glass is a liquid, too).

In music, change rhythm, change tone, change whatever, and you're in a new place, the ground melted, gravity shifted, different air density, etc. Videogames are a terrific medium for exploring this relationship, because in videogames the (visual) architectures can theoretically be as dynamic as musical architectures. I think there's always been a music-place relationship, but computers are going to allow us to do some insane new explorations of the implications of this.

***TDP:** To what extent are traditional music — with composers and performers on one side and listeners on the other — and interactive music like the sounds of Proteus the same art, and to what extent are they different? Is the match between indie game developers and indie musicians as heavenly as it seems from a player's perspective? Is this the next level of 21st century music, or is it a diverging art form?*

**DK:** I've been very excited about videogames for a while, all the dynamic possibilities, how radically different interactive music is from recorded music. I've practiced games and improvisation in parallel, because I think improvised music has a tremendous amount to teach us in terms of how a music space is constituted. Now, though, I'm becoming more interested in linear music and the virtual spaces it can create — these spaces are often more dynamic than videogame spaces, we haven't really learned how to make videogame music spaces with the confidence of musical flows like those that have been developing for millenia in different music processes/objects..

I think the trick is to come to terms with thinking these things 'interactive music' and 'fixed music' as the same thing, because all interactive music even is 'fixed' as a line of information when it has been played, and all fixed music creates a virtual music space in us, a sense of possibility that extends beyond the particulars of the piece. David Cope's EMI software takes input from old western classical composers — you can feed it 500 Bach chorales, for instance — and then it analyses them all, and recreates an image of a possibility space that can function as a generative mechanism to produce an indefinite number of Bach chorales. You can do this with other composers, too.

Now, as it is, it just produces a fixed piece of music, and that's what we get to touch, but what would be really amazing would be to touch that possibility space, that generative mechanism, to inhabit a *materialized* space with shifting walls and grounds, to feel out the gravities in this music in play, creating twisted new cut-ups...of course we'd be cutting in crazy N-dimensional structures rather than the lines, it'd be very different from a Burroughs/Gysin cut-up, sampled music. I'm interested in learning more about the algorithms used in all of this, because exploring the relationship between linear musics and dynamic musics is key, I think, in terms of moving forward with this stuff.

As for the 'next level of 21st century music' futurisms, Jaron Lanier said this in '96: "The art form of the next century is being born right now. It will be a fusion of the great arts of the 20th century: Jazz, Cinema, and Programming." ... who's to say, though? I'm definitely psyched on the prospect, and the fluid music form seems to have an incredibly rich and uncertain future ahead of it, LOTS of terrain to explore, which is a promising sign. And fun! It's all about PLAYING music again, a beautiful thing to try to reclaim. Of course, there's the irony of making OBJECTS in order to reclaim play, and maybe there are some dangers here, tech fetishism, forgetting that we can play anything at all (that's the ideal future, everyone playing everything, who cares what the tech is).
