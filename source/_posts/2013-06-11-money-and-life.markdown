story_intro: "<strong>[FREESPACE] ITSELF IS</strong> still <a href='/post/2013/06/11/reality-school'>a bit incoherent</a> ideologically. But it makes for a great venue for people who know what they want to say. Plus, [freespace] provides a wacko audience, so it’s friendly to unconventional ideas."

My friend Kendra co-founded a local currency here in the San Francisco Bay Area called [Bay Bucks](http://www.bay-bucks.com/). It’s backed by the goods and services of its member businesses, so they can use Bay Bucks to exchange value with each other without the use of debt-based, interest-bearing fiat money, known in our country as “dollars.” They’re off to a huge start as a B2B service, and once enough Bay Bucks start flying around, they’ll let customers start paying with them as well.

Kendra and her co-founder, Dr. Chong Kee Tan, screened a documentary in [freespace] last week to teach us all about the true nature of money and why they think local currencies are better for us. Here’s the film in full. Below, I’ll offer some prompts that came to me as we watched and discussed it.

- Do we treat money differently because of the mystical importance attached to it through the symbolism on the coins, bills, and banks themselves?
- What does it do to a social network when a member of it decides to leave the conventional economy, quit a job, use alternative currencies, &c?
- Does it matter to the advertising industry *what* you buy out of the desire evoked by ads, or simply *that* you buy?
- How is the desire created by media like the debt created by money?
- How are acts of kindness/generosity valued by our economy?
