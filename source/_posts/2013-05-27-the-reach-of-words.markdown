story_intro: "<strong>WORDS ARE GREAT</strong> and all, but they aren't magic bullets. We invented words to get ourselves out of a jam, and we got out. But we created many more problems than we solved."
---
The problem we solved was definitely more important than the consequences of solving it. We had gotten so smart, smarter than we could handle, and it was frustrating. In the firelight flickering in the dark cave, we looked in each other's eyes, and we knew we needed that light we saw looking back.

So we grunted our frustrations until we thought we understood each other.

Words let us out of our own heads, so we could finally think together. I wouldn't trade that back for anything, even to get rid of all the deception, manipulation, and politics we got in exchange. Would you?

But nor would I put all my faith in the power of words to solve humanity's communication problems. Skillful use of words has gotten us pretty far. But it can go wrong. We can convince each other and ourselves to do unspeakable things if the words make enough sense.

We can fall so deeply in love with a description of the world that we don't notice when the world changes. And when we speak with a mind that's full of illusions, the other people in the cave aren't going to understand us anymore.

That's why, alongside words, we invented another technology to help us communicate and know each other. We know it when we feel it. If we have to use a word for it, call it art. Art is how we know each other beyond the reach of words. And by blending the two, mixing art and words, we can get much closer to understanding.

In our era, we communicate more often, and with more people, than the first tellers and artists ever dreamed possible. We have [more portals open](/post/2013/05/27/how-are-you) than ever before. It takes practice to deal with it, and we need to improve. We don't want to slip back into the dark again.

I haven't been alive very long, but it seems like people find my words to be good practice. It is an honor to be able to help people this way. That's why I built this portal for you.

But I am wary of illusions. I don't trust words. That's why I studied music. Even though I've made my way in the world using words so far, I've never been more glad I studied music than I am today, keeping the portal. I need the music to counteract verbal illusions. And after [a portal trip](http://thedailyportal.com/issue/3/) a few weeks ago, I started writing some.

So don't be surprised if, someday soon, the portal starts singing to you.
