This transaction would not come naturally to me. Wearing a suit, that’s fine. I’m good at that part. I’m rarely called upon to do it, so I enjoy the novelty of dressing up in Western male conventions. But shopping is not a strong suit of mine.

*(Hold for groan.)*

I was working with limited information. I knew which department store supply chain carried the right make and model, and I knew the color was called “charcoal gray.” I didn’t know where to find this department store, exactly, but I had enough of a hunch to get on the subway and get off somewhere on Market Street in San Francisco.

I picked the Powell Street station because it’s directly underneath the mall. I emerged onto the food court and quickly became disoriented. After unsuccesfully attempting to ascend into the mall proper via a down-going escalator, it occurred to me to look at the YOU ARE HERE display. I searched in vain for several minutes, only to learn that this mall had no instance of the department store I needed.

So I walked out into open air for the first time since leaving Oakland 45 minutes prior. It’s incredible how many people are available for idle, public commerce in San Francisco on a Monday morning. 

I arrived at the city-block-sized clothes vending machine a few blocks away, only to quickly discover that there’s actually a separate five-story box for men's clothes across the street.

They didn’t want to mix their ubiquitous body-shaming ad messages, I suppose.

I had learned from my mistake, so I used the up escalators to go up this time. On the way to the top floor, I passed all kinds of posters of slime-covered, hairless males wearing only sunglasses with females licking their faces.

I found the gray men’s suits section, and I zeroed in on the brand I needed. There were five shades of gray, and none of them said “charcoal gray” on the tag. I wandered the rows of suits until I found a large, white man named Jay. Jay would be happy to help me. He led me away from the suits to a middle-aged computer terminal.

He asked me for some six-digit code for the suit, so I looked it up on my phone. He punched in the characters as I read them out. The computer reported that they had four of the right suit, but it quickly became apparent that the human operator couldn’t find them. He offered me a seat on a white leather sofa and headed downstairs, “It says we have them,” he said as he disappeared down the escalator.

Before long, five people were working on one computer to find this suit. They couldn’t tell how accurately to interpret the computer’s instructions. They argued over literal shades of gray.

Finally, one of the humans left the terminal to go try another computer in a back room. Jay explained, “She’s trying on her computer thing? To see if the inventory is really correct or not.”

As I waited, I tuned into the hopeless music, which I am unable to avoid doing in situations like this. It was pounding mid-tempo pop music, its future-schlock lyrics sung by a software-enhanced female human. “Then comes the solar flare. Something something find me there.” It then broke down into a bit of light dubstep, as one does. Google has produced ["Suspension" by Lights](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lights/suspension.html) as the culprit. Here. Enjoy.

“I found it! I think.” Jay returned triumphantly. The color name didn’t match — it’s just called “silver gray” now — but the number did. The numbers in the computer are the source of truth.

As Jay communed with the computer to process my transaction, he and his colleague, Leland, swapped good natured retail war stories. Leland claimed to know (after Jay told him) that “charcoal gray” is now called “silver gray.” Knowing this store and its wares seemed to be a competitive point of pride.

According to the made-up prices on the various computers, I saved over $400. How can that possibly reflect real economics?

With that ordeal out of the way, I took the suit for alterations at [Diaz Brothers](http://www.yelp.com/biz/diaz-brothers-tailors-san-francisco) on the 7th floor of an old Market Street office building. It was a small, crowded workshop full of men deftly wielding scissors and sewing machines. They did the alterations while I waited. They only deal in cash.
