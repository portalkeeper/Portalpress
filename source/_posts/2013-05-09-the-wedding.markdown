We've all known each other a long time, and I'm looking forward to the official start of their family. I'm ready for this specific case. What I'm not ready for is the general idea.

My friends are getting married? [Is this real life?](http://www.youtube.com/user/booba1234) He's about to become a doctor, too. It's so interesting to watch us all individuate. A married doctor and a... portal... guy... is quite a divergence.

But sure, I'll play grown-up. I've got [my suit](/post/2013/05/09/the-suit) and everything. I've got a Hafiz poem to read in the ceremony. And it'll be wonderful to see old friends again. Toward the end of next week, look forward to some stories about how that all goes down.
